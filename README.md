# Thread Pool Implementation  

This project demonstrates a custom thread pool implemented in C using the pthread library. The thread pool efficiently manages concurrent task execution with mutex locks and condition variables for synchronization. Tasks are dynamically queued and executed by worker threads. The implementation supports safe thread shutdown and resource deallocation. Ideal for learning multi-threaded programming and synchronization concepts in C.
